3. Summary:  *For me, the most important thing in my work is to feel involved and needed. To invent and create new things to help people. Ideally, create a project that will change the world for the better. For these purposes, I do not feel sorry for my efforts and time.
   I also understand that in order to come up with something you need to study, study a lot and be disciplined (I have already learned this).
   **I love people and respect their personal space, so not a conflict person.***
